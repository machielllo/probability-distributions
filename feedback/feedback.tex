\title{General Feedback}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section*{Assignment 1}
Below is some general feedback on the first assignment. If you have
any specific questions, feel free to ask them at the next tutorial.

\begin{itemize}
\item If a mathematical step is not generally true, add reasoning.
\item Make note of the support of a PDF, especially when constructing one.
\end{itemize}

Example:
$$\P{X=x, Y=y, N=n} = \P{X=x, Y=y}$$

Why does $N=n$ fall away: add reasoning.

Without mentioning ``if $x+y=n$'' or adding an indicator, the
statement is false.

\begin{itemize}
\item The exercises in the assignment explore the results from the BH
exercise. Keep this in mind while making the exercises and relate
back to the exercise in your answers when appropriate.
\end{itemize}

Example:

Many students did not realize that the PMF's in the final exercise
corresponded to $X\mid N=n$ from the BH exercise, where it was shown
that it has a uniform distribution.

If the code is difficult to interpret, keeping the BH exercise in
mind could make it easier.

\section*{Assignment 3}


\begin{itemize}
\item ``explain what you see'' $\neq $ ``describe what you see''
\end{itemize}

Example:

Why does it make sense that the graph is (concave) increasing? Use the
setting and formula.

\begin{itemize}
\item Be careful and precise in the descriptions of the shape.
\end{itemize}

Example:

Not all convex increasing functions are logarithmic.
